## Introduction
The full source code for AVSFA will be made publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.

## Requirements
we use a single RTX4090 24G GPU for training and evaluation. 
```
pytorch 1.9.0
torchvision 0.10.0
prettytable
easydict
```

### Prepare Datasets
Download the CUHK-PEDES dataset from [here](https://github.com/ShuangLI59/Person-Search-with-Natural-Language-Description), ICFG-PEDES dataset from [here](https://github.com/zifyloo/SSAN) and RSTPReid dataset form [here](https://github.com/NjtechCVLab/RSTPReid-Dataset)

Organize them in `your dataset root dir` folder as follows:
```
|-- your dataset root dir/
|   |-- <CUHK-PEDES>/
|       |-- imgs
|            |-- cam_a
|            |-- cam_b
|            |-- ...
|       |-- reid_raw.json
|
|   |-- <ICFG-PEDES>/
|       |-- imgs
|            |-- test
|            |-- train 
|       |-- ICFG_PEDES.json
|
|   |-- <RSTPReid>/
|       |-- imgs
|       |-- data_captions.json
```


## Training

```
sh run.sh
```
